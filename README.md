*Task 4 â€“ Productivity Tracker (Chrome Extension):
This task involves developing a Chrome extension that tracks the time spent on different websites and provides detailed productivity analytics. The extension uses content scripts to monitor active website usage and a background service worker to store data in a date-wise format, enabling weekly productivity reports.

The tool classifies websites into Productive (e.g., GitHub, LeetCode, Stack Overflow) and Unproductive (e.g., YouTube, Facebook, Instagram) categories. A dedicated dashboard displays analytics, including a pie chart (visualizing Productive vs Unproductive time) and a weekly report table summarizing total time spent per website.

The extension is built using JavaScript (Manifest V3), Chart.js for data visualization, and Chrome Storage API for local data persistence. Development and testing were carried out using Visual Studio Code, and the final project is ready for demonstration via GitHub.*
